# Test 2D project on Rust
A simple geometric project that currently visualizes the intersection of a circle and a line, and also reflects line from circle. 
There is also a simple implementation of user input for moving geometric shapes.
The project was created for educational purposes to try out the [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) library.
